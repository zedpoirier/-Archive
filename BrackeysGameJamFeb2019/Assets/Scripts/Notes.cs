    /* Theme: Love Is Blind - Brackeys Game Jam
     * Start Time: Feb 16 @ 3h
     * End Time: Feb 23 @ 0h
     * 
     * Rules:
     * 
     * No NSFW games.
     * Everything has to be made during the jam. You can't use code or assets you made before the jam or from other sources.
     * Assets from the asset store aren't allowed either, except assets that don't contribute to the game and are used to make 
     * the work easier and improve your workflow. Example of allowed assets: TextMesh Pro, ProBuilder, Post Processing Stack, 
     * ShaderGraph, A.K.A. Package Manager assets. Standard assets aren't allowed. Another exception to this rule are fonts, 
     * you can use them as long as they're free and you follow their license.
     * All game engines and frameworks are allowed.
     * Generators where you have some sort of control over the output are allowed (like sfxr). Completely automatic generators are not.
     * After the jam is over you are allowed to make small adjustments to the game jam entry as long as you provide a changelog. 
     * After the jam is over you can do whatever you want, but it would be nice to leave the jam entry page unchanged so people can 
     * play the original game in the future.
     * 
     * Ideas: 
     * Character talking with others at a party. 
     * The goal is to find the one true love, but this character is prone to fall in love with anyone they spend time with. 
     * You must investigate the traits of the party goers without giving in to your desire to fall in love. 
     * You must only allow yourself to fall in love if you are sure you've found THE ONE.
     * The right begins to go dark the more in love you are with someone.
     * At the start of the game you are given a set of traits (or just one?) that you must match up with another person.
     * There's also a time limit. 
     * Procedural? With increasing difficulty? Number of other people / Starting love values with people. "Your Ex is here"
     *
